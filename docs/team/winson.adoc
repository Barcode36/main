== PROJECT: ExpenseTracker

---

== 1. Overview

This portfolio aims to document the contributions that I made to the *ExpenseTracker*.

*ExpenseTracker* is a desktop expense tracking application developed to aid users in tracking their expenses and
save money. The user interacts with it using a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface
(GUI) created with JavaFX library. It is written in Java, and has about 20 kLoC.

Some of its main features are:

. Setting a budget for expenses.
. Multiple user accounts.
. Categorization of expenses.
. Statistics for expenses.


== 2. Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to have a budget on expenses.*
** Function: It informs the user if the their expenses exceed a set budget
** Justification: This is a core feature as it allows the user to know when they are spending too much money, the
main purpose of an expense tracker.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth
 analysis of software design alternatives. The implementation was challenging as it required changes to existing
 commands and the existing implementation of the main `ExpenseTracker` class.

* *Minor enhancements*:

. Added a `setRecurrenceFrequency` command that allows the user to reset their spending at a frequency of their choice.
. Added a `setCategoryBudget` command that allows the user to set budgets based on their category of expenses.
