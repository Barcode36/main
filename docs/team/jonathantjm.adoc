== Overview

This portfolio aims to document the contributions made by *Jonathan Tan Jit Ming* to the *Expense Tracker*.

*Expense Tracker* is a desktop expense tracking application developed to aid users in tracking their expenses and
save money. The user interacts with it using a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface
(GUI) created with JavaFX library. It is written in Java, and has about 20 kLoC.

Some of its main features are:

. Setting a budget for expenses.
. Multiple user accounts.
. Categorization of expenses.
. Statistics for expenses.

== Summary of contributions

* *Code contributed*: https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=jonathantjm
* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability for statistics of expenditures to be shown.*
** What it does: displays statistics of a user's expenditure by time and category in the form of a bar chart or pie chart.
** Justification: This is a core feature as it allows the user to be informed about their spending patterns over a period
of time or based on category
** Highlights: This feature required an in-depth understanding of the software architecture as it involves multiple
components of the application.

* *Minor enhancement*:

. Added a `Date` class that is used by `Expense`, which allows dates to be stored and compared.
