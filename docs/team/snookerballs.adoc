== PROJECT: ExpenseTracker

---

== Overview

Expense Tracker is the secure, efficient financial application for the keyboard enthusiast. With features such as daily tips,
statistics and budget setting, Expense Tracker aims to provide users with the necessary tools to become a better saver.

ExpenseTracker was created for an NUS software engineering project. The task was to work in a team of 5, and morph or enhance
an `AddressBook` application.

This portfolio is a documentation of my contributions to the morphing of AddressBook into ExpenseTracker. I mainly worked on GUI overhauls, as well
as the implementation of a Automatic Notification System.


== Summary of contributions

. *GUI Overhaul and Redesign*

* *What It Does*

** The morphing of `AddressBook` into `Expense Tracker` resulted in the implementation of many new features. My main job was to
implement a dynamically updating Graphical User Interface (GUI) for said features. The new GUI elements include:

*** *Notification Panel* - Displays the list of automated notifications.
*** *Budget Panel* - Displays information about the user's monthly total budget cap and expenses.
*** *Category Panel* - Displays information about the user's budget cap for different categories of expenses.

* *Justification*

** A well-designed user interface is able to maximize use experience and allows `Expense Tracker` to stand out amongst the sea
of financial applications. An eye catching and intuitive design encourages users to not only try our application, but to keep
using it as well. Small touches such as animation and dynamic changing of text color wre also implemented for improved visual feedback.

* *Highlights*

** The challenge of implementing this enhancement arose from the squashing of visual bugs caused by unexpected inputs such as overly
large numbers. Creativity and many design considerations were required to get the Expense Tracker GUI to look and function as I had envisioned.

. *Notification System*

* *What It Does*
** The Notification System facilitates the sending of automated messages to the user. These notifications are displayed
on the `NotificationPanel`.

* Justification
** I implemented this feature to appeal to the following users of `ExpenseTracker`:

*** For the user who struggles to save money *due to lack of knowledge about saving*, tips will be provided daily in the
form of notifications. Thus, the more a user uses `ExpenseTracker`, the more knowledgeable they can become about saving.

*** For the user who has *trouble maintaining their budget*, the Notification System sends automated warnings whenever the
user is or is about to spend over their budget.

*** For the user who is *does not need aids or warnings*, I have added the `notification` command. This commands
allows users to toggle the different types of notifications on and off, increasing the customizability of `ExpenseTracker`.

* *Highlights*
** The implementation of this feature involved all components of Expense Tracker, including the storing of data and the
implementation of a new command. The challenge mainly revolved around manipulating the way `Notification` and `Tip` objects
were stored, read and retrieved.

* *Minor enhancement*:
. Other Minor Animations such as GUI fade-in upon login.
. Complete Overhaul of CSS.
. Added color to Tags
