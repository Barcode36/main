== PROJECT: ExpenseTracker

---

== Overview

This portfolio aims to document the contributions made by *Jason Chong Yi Sheng* to the *ExpenseTracker*.

*ExpenseTracker* is a desktop expense tracking application developed to aid users in tracking their expenses and
save money. The user interacts with it using a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface
(GUI) created with JavaFX library. It is written in Java, and has about 20 kLoC. The product was morphed from an https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S1/addressbook-level4[Address Book] over 8 weeks
under the constraints described https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-website/admin/project-constraints.html[here].

Some of its main features are:

. Setting a budget for expenses.
. Multiple user accounts with data encryption.
. Categorization of expenses.
. Statistics for expenses.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *user accounts system with data encryption*
** What it does: Allows multiple users to use the application on the same machine without affecting each other's data. Also keeps each user's data encrypted and inaccessible by others.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because multiple users can share the application on the same computer. For many people, financial information is often kept private so this function allows them to use the application without fear of other's having unauthorized access to their spending data.
** The following are the highlights of this feature:
*** This enhancement adds a robust user accounts system that comes with several features, namely `signup`, `login` and `setpassword`. Each user's data file is kept separately and explicitly labelled with their username. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to how data is loaded in the `Storage` component and stored in the `Model` component.
*** The encryption algorithm also makes use of hash algorithms and the AES symmetric key encryption algorithm to ensure that no one can gain access to a user's information unless he/she knows the plain text password of the user, which is not stored anywhere.
** Credits: Google Guava library for common hashing algorithms.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a encrypt command to allow the user to manually encrypt strings for them to edit the data files directly

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com[Functional code]] [https://github.com[Test code]] _{give links to collated code files}_
